# TerningMatte
Terningspill for å trenne på summering av terninger

This code has been created to teach my son some basic object oriented programming.
It is a simple dice game where the object is to check off the number 1-9 or 1-12 based on two dices.
You either use one of the dices or the sum of them to check off these numbers.
This game is therefore also suited to train kids calculating the sum of 2 dices.
The game is based on a physical game with a board with 9 numbered wooden pins you flip up to mark a number ticked off.
The java code tries to map the physical game to java objects.
The code is in Norwegian to make it easier for a kid to understand the code.

If you feel this code can be usefull then feel free to use it.
I have chosen to make it GPL so that any one can use the code and changes will be tracked back for the common benefit.
Note that GPL means you can you use the code as you please for your own use but if you want to distribute it with your changes then you must share these changes.
